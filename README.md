Finding Exact Covers in NumPy (and Solving Sudoku!)
===================================================

## Python 3 port
~~This is a port of Moy's work to Python 3. It will no longer work with Python 2. The changes to the Python code might be compatible but the changes to the C++ code (Python module initialization) are not.~~

~~There is a wheel for Linux/x86 at https://github.com/jwg4/exact_cover_np/suites/1659981839/artifacts/30853501~~

~~You can probably get this working for other platforms if you're happy to build it yourself, but the full packaging is a work in progress.~~

# Update: use the new version of this package: 'exact_cover'

- https://pypi.org/project/exact-cover/
- https://github.com/jwg4/exact_cover

This is an updated version of this package which is newly repackaged, on pypi, has all the bugfixes and other modifications here, and some more.

#### Please use the new package 'exact_cover' instead of this package!
#### Please go to the new repo for any issues/suggestions/reports/contributions!

### Other components
#### xudoku
Some of the code from the old package has been repackaged. If you want to solve sudoku, that code is at:
- https://pypi.org/project/xudoku/
- https://github.com/jwg4/xudoku
#### polyomino
### If you want to solve polyomino tiling problems, that code is at:
- https://pypi.org/project/polyomino/
- https://github.com/jwg4/polyomino

## Sorry for people who already followed a link from a previous deprecated version!
## Please let me know if you are having any trouble getting this version, the new version, Moy's old version or the old Pypi version to work!
